## I want to learn more about APIs

I've heard that if you play The Greatest Love of All backwards, the lyrics are "we believe that data is the future, build APIs and let the people play".

If you do any development, you're already working with them in some form. I want to learn how to dive in and build things with designed APIs from various third-party services. I'd like to hear a couple "intro to" talks and then get my hands on the keyboard working on something. When I have a question, I want to be able to talk with someone that helped build the API or someone else that has worked with it.

I want it so much that I'm going to run an event to make it happen.

## Sound cool?

If this sounds like something you'd be even remotely interested in, would you mind answering a couple questions?
