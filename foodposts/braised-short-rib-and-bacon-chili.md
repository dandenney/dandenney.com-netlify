<p class="dd-u-mt-0">I had to veer from the original directions a bit, since I don’t have a Dutch oven and I couldn’t find boneless short ribs. Plus, I wanted to add some flavor to the meat upfront.</p>

1.  Put the bacon on a baking sheet and in a cold oven, set to 400 degrees. Cook until it’s about 3/4 done, about 15 minutes.
2.  Add salt, pepper, 2 garlic cloves, and 1 tablespoon of olive oil to a glass bowl. Cut the spare ribs into squares and soak them in the marinade.
3.  Heat the oil in a pot over medium- high heat. Add the beef in batches and cook until browned on all sides. Cut and add the bacon as well.
4.  Remove the beef and set aside in a bowl. Add the onion, garlic, and jalapeño and sauté about 3 - 5 minutes in the marinade.

1.  Add the beef, bacon, cumin, chili powder, tomatoes, tomato paste, beef stock, and beans into a slow cooker. Add chili sea salt and pepper.
2.  Bonus beef stock. Add the short rib bones, peppers, onion, thyme, oregano, rosemary, and 8 cups of water into a pot. Bring to a boil

1.  Wait for the stock to reduce to a brownish color. It took about 2 hours.
2.  Strain the stock into a sealable container to save.
3.  Let the slow cooker do its thing for the chili, occasionally stirring.

It's delicious! Aside from speeding up the prep time, there are a couple of things that I can improve next time. I'd like it to be a little more thick, so either reduce the beef stock or increase the paste.

<p class="dd-u-mb-0">The short rib isn't as soft as I'd like it to be, though that's been my experience every time with slow cooker meat so far. I'd like it to be falling apart. Aside from learning how to do that, I'd like to experiment with adding ground beef or replacing the short rib with it altogether.</p>
