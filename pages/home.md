## Hi! I'm Dan Denney and I'm a front-end developer at DataCamp.

I have been working closely with designers and writing HTML/CSS and JS since 2008ish, and founded [Front-End Conf](http://frontenddesignconference.com) with Cherrie, in 2009. Our friends from [Unmatched Style](http://unmatchedstyle.com) are keeping it going these days.
