## Hi! I'm Dan Denney and I'm a front-end developer at DataCamp.

I have been working closely with designers and writing HTML/CSS and JS since 2008ish. In 2009, [Cherrie](https://twitter.com/cherriedenney) and I founded [Front-End Conf](http://frontenddesignconference.com), and our friends from [Unmatched Style](http://unmatchedstyle.com) are keeping it going these days.
